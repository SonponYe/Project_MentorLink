# MentorLink

Mentorship platform connecting students with verified professional mentors — structured goals, milestone tracking, and real-time chat.

**Stack:** ASP.NET Core Web API · Blazor WebAssembly · SignalR · Entity Framework Core · PostgreSQL (Supabase)

## Recent project updates

- API and client projects are fully wired together with JWT authentication, authorization, and CORS for the Vercel frontend.
- The app now includes the core mentor platform flow: sign-up/login, mentorship requests, acceptance/decline workflow, dashboards, goals, notifications, and SignalR live chat.
- Default runtime behaviour uses an in-memory EF Core database so the project runs immediately without setup; PostgreSQL/Supabase can be enabled by setting a connection string.
- The Blazor client contains the full student, mentor, and admin experience across the 14 screens listed below.
- Automated xUnit tests cover auth, password hashing, access control, mentorship flow, goals, and notifications.

## Run it

```bash
dotnet run --project src/MentorLink.Api
```

Then open http://localhost:5180. The Blazor client is served by the API, so that one command runs everything.

**Demo accounts** (password `demo1234`):

| Role    | Email                  | Lands on              |
|---------|------------------------|-----------------------|
| Student | `amara@student.dev`    | Student Dashboard     |
| Mentor  | `nnamdi@mentor.dev`    | Mentor Dashboard      |
| Admin   | `admin@mentorlink.dev` | Mentor Verification   |

Tip: open two browser windows (one normal, one private), sign in as Amara in one and Dr. Okafor in the other, and chat — messages arrive live over SignalR.

## Live site

- Front end (Vercel): https://mentorlink-client.vercel.app
- API (Render): https://project-mentorlink.onrender.com

## Tests

```bash
dotnet test
```

38 automated tests boot the API against an in-memory database and cover login and sign-up, password hashing, access control, the request → accept / decline flow, goals and notifications. The manual checklist is in [docs/TEST_PLAN.md](docs/TEST_PLAN.md).

## Database — Supabase (PostgreSQL)

Out of the box the app uses an **in-memory database** with seed data, so it runs with zero setup (data resets on restart).

To switch to Supabase:

1. In your Supabase project go to **Settings → Database → Connection string** and copy the direct connection values.
2. Put them in `src/MentorLink.Api/appsettings.json`:

```json
"ConnectionStrings": {
  "DefaultConnection": "Host=db.YOUR-PROJECT-REF.supabase.co;Port=5432;Database=postgres;Username=postgres;Password=YOUR-DB-PASSWORD;Ssl Mode=Require;Trust Server Certificate=true"
}
```

3. Restart the app. On startup EF Core applies the migrations in `src/MentorLink.Api/Migrations/` and seeds the demo data into an empty database.

> If your network blocks direct connections (IPv6), use Supabase's **session pooler** connection string instead — same format, host like `aws-0-REGION.pooler.supabase.com`, port `5432`, username `postgres.YOUR-PROJECT-REF`.

## Notes / known simplifications (fine for an MVP, fix before production)

- The chat hub trusts the user ID the client sends; it should use the signed-in user from the JWT instead.
- `GET /api/mentorships/student/{id}` doesn't require a token yet.
- Endpoints take user IDs in the URL and don't check they belong to the signed-in user.
- An empty database is seeded with demo accounts — turn this off before real users sign up.
- File attachments in chat and photo upload are placeholders.
